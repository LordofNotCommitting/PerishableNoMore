**This mod requires MCM to run.**

All perishable items that reaches expiration date will now become non-perishable if mod is enabled. (disabled by default)

**Need to restart the game after MCM config setup for this mod to take effect. On existing save, existing clone with unupdated implant count must have new augment installed to have implant count updated.**

Once a stack becomes non-perishable there is no going back regardless of mod being enabled or not.
Any perishable item being merged with non-perishable stack will become non-perishable (I think).

If you want to get the product of perishable item, you need to turn mod off via MCM or unsub, then let the perishable stack reach the expiration date.

Have MCM option to turn it on or off just so people can get antibiotics. (still requires restart)

Comment for v1.1: I have created "unbreak item" button which will reset all expire date to default value which should resolve the issue. (still requires restart, will also undo the frozen duration item effect)
I have confirmed that sort related issue had nothing to do with this mod, but it is good to have an option to undo freezing.

Have it on for a 1 in game hour ->save and exit -> and turn it off. one instance of it being active reset expiration date of all cargo items.

ChangeLog:

v1.1: "unbreak item" button which will reset all expire date to default value.
